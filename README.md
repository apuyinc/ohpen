Testing the GitHub API using Karate framework

Task accomplished:

* Endpoints GET, POST, DELETE

* Basic test report, even though I didn't manage to configure it in circleci, report is generated and can be read it locally
* Tet report is generated with header, request and response information, so it is useful to see what is happening with out needing to see the logs
